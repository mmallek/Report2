\section{Historic Range of Variability}

\subsection{Disturbance Regime}

This report focuses on the effects of wildfire as a natural disturbance; the impacts of other natural disturbances during the reference period were likely localized in time or space and therefore probably had far less impact on vegetation patterns over broad spatial and temporal scales than did fire (KEEP?). In the sections below, we briefly describe the simulated disturbance regime (i.e., spatial extent and distribution, frequency and temporal variability). In this subsection, we refrain from describing variations among vegetation types - this will be accomplished in the section on (TITLE?) Vegetation Patterns and Dynamics. Finally, it is important to realize that while the information below is presented as ``results,'' it could have easily been presented in the methods section as ``model calibration.'' Key spatial and temporal aspects of the disturbance regime were evaluated during preliminary ``calibration'' runs, and subsequent adjustments were made to model parameters to effect desired changes. Thus, while the information presented below does in fact represent results (output) of the simulation, it also represents a set of targets used to calibrate the model (i.e., adjust model parameters to achieve desired results). While this may seem a bit circular, it was a necessary process for a complex model such as RMLANDS. Moreoever, our real emphasis was on quantifying the vegetation patterns and dynamics resulting from these disturbance processes.

\paragraph{Disturbed Area}

% 174830 eligible hectares
% 181550 hectares in core
Approximately 96\% of the landscape was eligible for wildfire disturbance (all cover types except Barren and Water). As expected, the frequency and extent of simulated wildfires varied across timesteps. Remarkably, given the rotation interval and percent mortality expected over time on this landscape, large proportions of the project area burned each (5-year) timestep. On average, at least 10\% of the landscape burned at some combination of low and high mortality every decade. Fires covering at least 25\% of the landscape burned approximately every 25 years, and half or more of the landscape burned at a 200 year interval. The smallest area disturbed over the course of the simulation was 0.26\%, while the largest was 66.2\% (of which 22.91\% was high mortality). About a third of the disturbed area burned as high mortality (which does include the burning of early development vegetation, including chaparral).
